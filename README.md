This repository is created for the course Practical Programming and Numerical Methods. The exercises can be found in the exercise folder, where they are named after the name given on the website. The same is done with the homework problems. Both follow the structure: Out.txt is the output/answer to the problem, MAKEFILE is self explainable, main.cpp contains the main functions and the rest of the files are helper files/functions.
